# devcontainer

## Overview

It allows an easy (version controllable) setup of a development environment inside a container. This is mostly used in VScode (https://docs.ros.org/en/iron/How-To-Guides/Setup-ROS-2-with-VSCode-and-Docker-Container.html).

For more information see https://containers.dev/


## Who is this for?

It is good for people without easy access to a ROS install, that don't want to setup lxc or a vm (people with different operating systems/distros)
